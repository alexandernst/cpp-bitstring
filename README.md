CPP Bitstring is a library that will help you to deal with random data that you need to parse and process.

Inspired by [Python's Bitstring](https://code.google.com/p/python-bitstring/), CPP Bitstring is able to perform
read/write operations on random chunks of data, letting you to seek, rewind, read and patch the data.

This is still a basic library, you'll probably miss quite some things, if so, please use the [New Issue](https://github.com/alexandernst/cpp-bitstring/issues/new) button.
